    "Interest rates, applied mechanics and gas dynamics are some examples of real-world problems which are modeled by nonlinear equations. \n",
    "\n",
    "For those types of problem, we doesn't search for an analytic solution, but instead try to approximate the results by using different methods, such as **bisection**, **Newton's** and **fixed point iteration**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Bisection algorithm provides us with an upper bound for the error\n",
    "\n",
    "* Newton's method is limited by the divergence when $f'(x)$ goes to infinite, but has the advantage of **quadratic convergence**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* For the fixed point iteration, since we are dealing on the contraction $\\phi(x)$ instead of the function $f(x)$, we are trying to converge towards the diagonal instead of the x axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "* In order to guarantee existence of a fixed point, we need to set continuity as a necessary condition. The fixed point must be unique in the case that $f'(x) < 1$ and have some specific conditions on its first and second derivative function."
